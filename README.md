# Airbnb-Analysis
This project harnesses MongoDB Atlas for Airbnb data analysis, employing Streamlit to craft an interactive web app featuring detailed geospatial visualizations. Insights into pricing, availability, and location trends are derived, offering users seamless exploration.

The file Airbnb_cleanup.ipynb has to be run first, as it would extract the data from Mongodb atlas and perform all the necessary cleaning.
Then can run the file Airbnb_Main_Streamlit.py file for the detailed visualisation of the data.
